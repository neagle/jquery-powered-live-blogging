* AOL.com wanted a live blog for the first Presidential debate
* Engadget has an awesome live blog
* Joe Bartlett's Live Blog Publisher: fancy!
* Uses deferreds, other awesome stuff.
* AOL.com's version of jQuery is 1.5.2
* Sad foghorn.
* Can't we get AOL.com to upgrade their version of jQuery?
* Umm, no. Lots of testing. Tight turnaround.
* Dave Artz: "Just remake it! It can't be that complicated."
* "But there's already a great implementation of it."
* Grumble Grumble
* Rebuild!

* Build as a jQuery Plugin
* Build as TWO jQuery Plugins
* jQuery events are the perfect way to broadcast data.
* One plugin to interact with the API and broadcast events, one plugin to listen and build a UI.

* API: callback structure, caching scheme (note about cache setting for AJAX)

* UI: original vision was that it was a lightweight UI, many sites would want to roll their own
* Original feature set: display posts, update them, delete them
* Actually, we need: permalinks, slider, Tweet buttons, DIMS for thumbnails
* ACTUALLY, we need: pop-up dialog for images, imagesLoaded plugin, tag filtering, updates notification
* (Still more! Featured author functionality)
* Taking too long to load when there are a lot of updates
* Optimize perceived load time: setTimeout, load in chunks

* Optimize ping interval... turn off pinging when not visible with jQuery Sonar

* Lessons learned:
* Effective UI happens slowly, with iteration, and comes from observing something being used
* Simple is good, but lack of architecture can limit growth. UI feels like it needs a view structure
* Automated build, effortless local environment, standardized project syntax with linting makes development a pleasure



jQuery-Powered Live Blogging
============================

jQuery Plugin Format
jQuery events for API returns
jQuery plugin pattern for methods / instantiation

Grunt JS
========
* Concatenation and minification
* Linting
* Local server
* Watch

Compass
=======
* Nesting
* Mixins for browser compatibility
* Variables (Twitter example)

Optimization
============
* Sonar to turn on / off polling (note how easy it was to use with existing live / die methods)
* Just-in-time loading for Tweet buttons
* Use of setTimeouts and chunks to improve perceived load time




The audience is anyone in technology--usually folks who are in a
technical
role (engineers). Purpose is to share/talk about a specific technology
(internal or external) and how your team is applying and utilizing it
currently. The idea is to share your experience and knowledge, what
worked
and what didn't, and hope it'll provide opportunity to collaborate with
others who may be interested in applying to their work. The session takes
place during the lunch hour (12:00 -1:00) where we'll provide food and
refreshment to attendants. So ideally, you should allot ~40 minutes to
provide a brief overview of the technology, your team's implementation
and
some lessons learned followed by ~15 minutes of Q&A.
